Draft:

We should have:

mrcp-lab:
  - methods:
    - create_server : create MRCP server (includes both SIP and MRCP endpoints)
    - create_call : creates a SIP call
    - connect: connect to MRCP server (can only be called after 'answer'). We could integrate this automatically with the SIP processing. However, since this is a testing tool we want to be able to do things like delay the MRCP connection, close the MRCP connection while MRCP request is being processed etc.
    - disconnect: closes the MRCP connection
    - send (sends MRCP request)
    - terminate (sends CANCEL (if '100 Trying' was received) or BYE)

    - accept: sends '100 Trying'
    - answer: sends '200 OK'
    - refuse: sends non-200 OK

  - events:
      'accepted' (100 Trying)
      'answered' (200 OK)
      'msg' (MRCP message: response or event)
      'end' (BYE, non-2XX)
      'new_call': new call arrived to the server

We will use sip.js for the SIP stack and mrcp for the MRCP stack.
